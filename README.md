# markov_chain
Simple markov chain for tweet generator 


![](https://github.com/s3nh/markov_chain/blob/master/imgs/markov_chains.png)


Based on reddit r/machinelearning and r/deeplearning headers.

thanks to [Adrian](https://github.com/xadrianzetx) for informative dataset 


## To do

- tweepy

- /html template


in progress


# examples 


```

mchain = MarkovChainGen(16, 120, 'dataset.txt)
model = mchain.build()
mchain.generate_text(model)

```

Some results 


```
- from method appreciated Google Turning Lucrative Search Over Machines Deep Learning Library from IDSIA Deep Learning resources Unsupervised Incremental Learning Predict

-  Help understanding reparameterization trick auto encoding variational bayes fully connected layers barely learning Dispelling hype listen experts

- tutorials that translate Tensorflow code physical systems Feeding Noise Trained Image Classifier Learning Distributed Word Representations with Neural

```


Next - CharRNN in Pytorch.
